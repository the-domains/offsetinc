description: "I am an ecologist that specialises in out of the box solutions. I'm about to embark on a great adventure across South Africa. Along with my Dad, we've entered the Race Across South Africa (RASA in mountain biking circles). Well be riding for 21 days across this amazing country in June. I'm taking my trusty GoPro along and plan to take some seriously awesome photos and videos that I can't wait to share. I'm a little nervous and the training is at an intense stage. But I'm confident that age (me) and experience (my Dad) are up to the challenge. This is a little photo I took while I was up near Sani Pass recently. We have a lot of these crystal clear river to look forward to on our adventure. Unfortunately they are likely to be just above freezing when we wade through them. "
