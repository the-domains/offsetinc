Some thoughts:

# Working in Durban

I've moved to Durban to try and gain some form of life style and the opposite has been true. Office hours are archaic. 8 until 5\. Who moves to Durban to spend more time inside than out, to never get to the beach and to never see the sun. 

I am planning to leave this place. It perhaps feels more oppressive due to the abundant alternatives. A friend of mine said to me today that she wishes to spend more time doing what she wants to do and she wants to be happy. A simple happy life focusing on what brings her joy. I found this wonderfully inspiring. It is a simple message and it is plastered everywhere but it is essential to happiness I am convinced.
