I'm a part time photographer and as part of my work I get to travel to some truly amazing and beautiful places. All of the images uploaded here were taken by me and are if you might be interested for sale as limited edition prints.

We were so lucky to see this shoebill snag a lungfish out of the swamp and slurp it down. The freshest sashimi I've ever witnessed.
